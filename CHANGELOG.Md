## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How is this different from GNOME's built-in search?**  
A: Spotlight Search is faster, more focused, and keyboard-centric. It provides instant file search and inline calculations without leaving your workflow.

**Q: Does it work on Wayland?**  
A: Yes! Works perfectly on both X11 and Wayland sessions.

**Q: Can I change the keyboard shortcut?**  
A: Yes, edit the `KEYBINDING` in `extension.js` CONFIG section.

**Q: Will this slow down my system?**  
A: No, the search is optimized and only runs when actively typing. CPU usage is minimal.
